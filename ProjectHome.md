## TCP Speedometer ##

Tcpmeter is a client-server application written in Go, that is used to measure upload, and download throughput of a TCP link between the client and the server machines. The client uses a Web based UI to provide real-time measurements of the speed as well as logging the data for post processing. The control protocol between the client and the server is simple and uses the Go language RPC package.
